## part 1/4

```
The CSO of a famous company is looking for skilled hackers to join his team.

He sent the following challenge:

I setup a website to challenge your skill as a pentester
Find me over the Internet as I stand by the nickname Zer0DayH4ckz0r
If you reach my website you should be able to gain control of a server
You will then need to go deeper and find a pivot
Finally if your are good enough you will send me my own password as a NTLM hash
Good luck!
```

This first part is an OSINT challenge. We google the nickname `Zer0DayH4ckz0r` and we find [his Twitter](https://twitter.com/Zer0DayH4ckz0r/). If we scroll down we find [his GitHub](https://github.com/Zer0DayH4ckz0r). (We could have used [this tool](https://whatsmyname.app/) to find these accounts.)

We open his first repository, open the commit history and [the penultimate commit](https://github.com/Zer0DayH4ckz0r/instagram-terminal-news-feed/commit/f68fd2cdea9ad63b9817543d436913f22ec10180) looks interesting (`Oops, removed credentials from repo`):
